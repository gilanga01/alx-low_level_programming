Learn what are `make`, Makefiles.
When, why and how to use Makefiles.
What are rules and how to set and use them.
What are explicit and implicit rules.
What are the most common / useful rules.
What are variables and how to set and use them.


* **0. make -f 0-Makefile** - Create your first Makefile. - ` 0-Makefile`.
* **1. make -f 1-Makefile** - Create a Makefile with the given requirements. - `1-Makefile`.
* **2. make -f 2-Makefile** - Create your first useful Makefile. - `2-Makefile`.
* **3. make -f 3-Makefile** - Create a Makefile with the given requirements. - `3-Makefile`.
* **4. A complete Makefile** -  Create a Makefile with the given requirements. - `4-Makefile`.
---
* **5. Island Perimeter** - Create a function `def island_perimeter(grid):` that returns the perimeter of the island described in `grid`. - `5-island_perimeter.py`.
	```
	*	grid is a list of list of integers:
		*	0 represents a water zone.
		*	1 represents a land zone.
		*	One cell is a square with side length 1.
		*	Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
		*	Grid is rectangular, width and height don’t exceed 100.
	*	Grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is one island (or nothing).
	*	The island doesn’t have “lakes” (water inside that isn’t connected to the water around the island).
	```
